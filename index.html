            <h1>Listen Before You Sing</h1>
            <hr>
            <p>Last year I enjoyed the movie Listen Before You Sing. It is a movie based on a true story of a poorly-funded school in Taiwan
                in a rural aboriginal community. Although aboriginal culture in Taiwan 
                traditionally has a lot of music and singing, these traditions are 
                fading. A couple of teachers thought it would be a good idea to 
                enter the students into a national singing competition as a way to help
                save the school. The story is about the aboriginal children learning 
            to sing and competing against schools in the cities with far greater resources.</p>
